# NP-Hysteresis

These files are part of the project to reproduce the results of the R. P. Tan, J. Carrey, and M. Respaud paper (PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 214421 (2014)).
They used a Montecarlo algorithm to obtain the hysteresis curves of magnetic nanoparticles inside a lysosome.

It's not a finished project, so is still in development. Perhaps there could be some lines in spanish because it's my native language, but i tried to explain it in comments in english.

The first part of the project consisting in define the functions to use during all the procces is complete. Now the work is in concatenate the functions to work during a periodic transform of conditions.
